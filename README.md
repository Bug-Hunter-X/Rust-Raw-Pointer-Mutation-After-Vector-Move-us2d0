This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming involving raw pointers and vector manipulation.  The `bug.rs` file shows incorrect usage that leads to undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version emphasizing safe memory management practices in Rust.  The issue arises from modifying a vector's content through a raw pointer after the vector's ownership changes.
